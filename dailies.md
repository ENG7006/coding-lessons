# Dailies

### Week 1 Dailies
#### Five dailies
* Draw a house
* Draw a car
* Draw a rocket
* Draw an object that belongs to the category of "things that move" (you do not need to animate it)
* Draw an object that belongs to the category of "things that do not move"

### Week 2 Dailies
#### Three dailies
* Refactor one of your shapes from week 1 using variables and functions and, possibly, objects to make it more reusable and extensible. (The ideal here, although it is not *quite* a requirement, is that you have an object that has an x and a y property that moves the object as a single entity.) NB: You may wish to radically simplify your shape before attempting refactoring. *The spec here is this:* at least four of your own variables and one of your own functions. This is the minimum; you will probably want to take this substantially further.
* ```ball``` #1: make the ball bounce horizontally
* ```ball``` #2: make the ball bounce vertically

### Week 3 Dailies
#### Three dailies
* ```ball``` #3: Make the ball bounce in both directions. By this I mean: the ball moves in both directions, horizontal and vertical, and the ball continues its horizontal motion after bouncing off the top or bottomâ€”and likewise, it continues its vertical movement after bouncing off the left or right side.

And then, two of the following three uses/modifications of [movable-shape](https://github.com/eng7006/movable-shape):
* ```movable-shape``` #1: Animate the car so that it "drives" horizontally using ```movable-shape```.
* ```movable-shape``` #2: Animate the rocket so that it "takes off" vertically using ```movable-shape```.
* ```movable-shape``` #3: Animate one of your "things-that-move" from week 1 using ```movable-shape```.

NB: The best way to work with ```movable-shape``` is to fork it, and immediately create your two different branches. Then edit each branch separately, and submit separate pull requests for each branch.

### Weeks 4 & 5 Dailies
There are five dailies related to ```bubbles```:

* Start with a blank canvas, adding a ```Bubble``` wherever the user clicks.
* Start with 500 ```Bubble```s on the canvas. (You may wish to either include, or not, the interactive functionality from the first daily.) **Hint:** This requires a loop, and cannot be done (easily) using a callback (although if you're curious, [here's the hack to do it functionally](https://github.com/eng7006/blob/master/functional-array-hack.md)).
* Instead of collecting at the top, the ```Bubble```s should move upwards continuously. By this I mean, once a ```Bubble``` reaches the top, instead of floating and fizzing there, it should move upwards off the canvas, *and reappear by emerging from the bottom of the canvas*. A variation: instead of a particular ```Bubble``` disappearing at the top and reappearing at the bottom, when a ```Bubble``` disappears at the top, a new, different ```Bubble``` emerges at the bottom at a random x position. Either way, the effect should be a constantly upward-moving field of ```Bubbles```.
* Whatever method you use in ```draw()``` to iterate across the ```Bubble```s in the first daily (or wherever you perform the iteration), write the same code using the alternative method. If you used ```forEach()``` and a callback, use a loop (either ```for``` or ```while```), whichever you prefer. Or, if you used a loop, write the iteration using ```forEach()```.
* Finally, create a sketch that animates a lot of somethings that are neither ```Bubbles``` nor ```Balls```. Keep these simple!

On this last daily project, a few suggestions:
* You'll want to create a constructor function and a prototype object. Feel free to adapt the code from either ```bubbles``` or ```oo-balls```.
* This prototype object should have the same basic structure as a ```Bubble``` or a ```Ball```: a relatively simple object with a position (x and y) and speed (x and y).
* It should also likely contain, according to convention, both ```update()``` and ```display()``` functions, as all our objects in p5 tend to.
* Beyond that, these can be whatever you'd like.
