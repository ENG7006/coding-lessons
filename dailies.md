# Dailies

### Week 1 Dailies
#### Five dailies
* Draw a house
* Draw a car
* Draw a rocket
* Draw an object that belongs to the category of "things that move" (you do not need to animate it)
* Draw an object that belongs to the category of "things that do not move"

### Week 2 Dailies
#### Three dailies
* Refactor one of your shapes from week 1 using variables and functions and, possibly, objects to make it more reusable and extensible. (The ideal here, although it is not *quite* a requirement, is that you have an object that has an x and a y property that moves the object as a single entity.)
* ```ball``` #1: make the ball bounce horizontally
* ```ball``` #2: make the ball bounce vertically

### Week 3 Dailies
#### Three dailies
* ```ball``` #3: Make the ball bounce in both directions. By this I mean: the ball moves in both directions, horizontal and vertical, and the ball continues its horizontal motion after bouncing off the top or bottomâ€”and likewise, it continues its vertical movement after bouncing off the left or right side.

And then, two of the following three
* ```movable-shape``` #1: Animate the car so that it "drives" horizontally using ```movable-shape```.
* ```movable-shape``` #2: Animate the rocket so that it "takes off" vertically using ```movable-shape```.
* ```movable-shape``` #3: Animate one of your "things-that-move" from week 1 using ```movable-shape```.

NB: The best way to work with ```movable-shape``` is to fork it, and immediately create your two different branches. Then edit each branch separately, and submit separate pull requests for each branch.
